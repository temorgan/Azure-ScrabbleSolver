# Azure-ScrabbleSolver
An educational project integrating practical Git skills with Python development to create a Scrabble solver, demonstrating the application of Large Language Models and version control

## Project Overview
Azure-ScrabbleSolver is a Python application designed to solve Scrabble puzzles by generating valid word permutations from given tiles. This project serves as a practical extension of theoretical learnings from Large Language Models (LLM) and OpenAI courses, emphasizing real-world applications of concepts like tokenization, neural architectures, and embeddings.

## Educational Objective
The primary educational goal of this project is to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge acquired through coursework and practical implementation skills. This is achieved by developing a fully functional software that not only serves its intended purpose but also provides a sandbox for experimenting with version control systems, specifically Git.

## Features
- Generates all possible valid permutations for a set of Scrabble tiles.
- Validates permutations against a comprehensive English dictionary.
- Utilizes advanced data structures like Tries for efficient word lookups.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
